    returned. The design canvas passes a fixture from `.preview/fixtures`.
    That is the whole point of the generic — there is exactly one rendering
    path, and the canvas is just another caller of it.

    `loading` and `error` are explicit props, not values encoded in a magic
    state string, so an app drives them straight from its query state. */

      Optional on purpose. A page must still be usable with no actions at all,
      because the design canvas renders every page without a server behind it —
      controls fall back to the local state that already makes them visibly
      respond (CONVENTIONS §2). Passing actions upgrades that local echo into
      a real write; omitting them must never make a control inert.

      Handlers may be async and may throw. A page shows the failure through the
      same `error` surface it uses for a failed read, so a write that fails is
      as visible as a read that fails. */
