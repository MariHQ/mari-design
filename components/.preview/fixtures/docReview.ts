const EDITOR_MD = `# Authentication Service Migration

## 1. Overview
The new authentication service replaces the legacy session store with stateless JWT tokens. It is expected to reduce login latency by roughly 40% and remove the shared-session bottleneck.

Tokens are signed with RS256 and rotated every 24 hours. Downstream services validate signatures against the published JWKS endpoint.

## 2. Rollout phases
We will roll out the change in three phases across the fleet.

### 2.1 Canary
Route 5% of traffic through the new service and watch error rates for 48 hours.

### 2.2 Ramp
Increase to 50% once the canary is stable, tracking p99 latency closely.

### 2.3 Cutover
Full cutover after a clean week. The order is fixed:

1. Drain the legacy session store
2. Flip the router
3. Revoke the old signing key

## 3. Risks
- Token replay if clock skew exceeds the allowed window
  - Clock skew above 90 seconds fails validation outright
- JWKS downtime blocks all signature validation
- Rollback requires draining every active token

| Phase | Traffic | Watch for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canary | 5% | error rate, p99 |
| Ramp | 50% | p99 latency |
| Cutover | 100% | token replay |

> Rollback is not free: draining active tokens signs every user out.

#### Open question
Whether the 24-hour rotation cadence is a requirement or a habit.`;
