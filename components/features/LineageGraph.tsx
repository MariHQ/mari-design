/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Lineage graph canvas (feature: lineage-graph)

   The central instrument of the lineage page: a directed graph of document
   nodes + typed edges, drawn as inline SVG edges under absolutely-positioned
   HTML node cards over a faint paper grid. There is no graph engine behind it
   and none is planned: the layout arrives with the data (the server does the
   auto-layout), so the canvas only has to place, filter and draw.

   The canvas is live, not a picture: drag the background to pan, drag a node to
   move it, click to select, and the zoom controls drive a real scale transform.
   Filters, lens, layout and zoom come from the shared control store, so the
   toolbar above actually operates this canvas.

   Node design: FLAT cream cards. The type/source is a solid bar down the LEFT
   edge, backed by an icon and a mono source label, so color is never the only
   distinguisher. Relations differ by color AND dash pattern AND weight AND the
   code printed on the edge.

   A real lineage graph is hundreds of nodes and edges. Drawn literally, 150
   cards over a 1000×560 canvas overlap into a hairball, every edge code stacks

   1. CAP     — draw at most `maxNodes` cards, keeping the best-connected ones

   2. PACK    — the authored layout arrives as 0..1 fractions, which say
                nothing about how wide a card is. Whenever those fractions put
                two card BOXES on top of each other at the canvas's real pixel
                size, the packer takes over: source lanes, laid out in pixels
                around the card box plus a minimum gap, so cards cannot touch.
                A layout that already reads clear is left exactly as authored.
