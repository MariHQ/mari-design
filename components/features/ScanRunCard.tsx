/* A background run, followed from the page that started it.
 *
 * Several pages offer a "scan the corpus" control. Each of those is a
 * multi-minute pass through a model that writes to a ledger, so each one is a
 * real flow with a run, a progress reading and a step history — not a link
 * that fires and forgets, which is what they used to be.
 *
 * The card lives here rather than in each page for the ordinary reason: two
 * pages showing the same run in two hand-built cards is how the two drift.
